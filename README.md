# Fifteen Puzzle Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Fifteen Puzzle game using vanilla JavaScript. The objective of the game is to arrange the numbered tiles on a 3x3 grid in the correct numerical order by sliding them into the empty space.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Use your mouse or touchpad to slide the tiles horizontally or vertically into the empty space.
3. Continue moving the tiles until you arrange them in the numerical order from 1 to 8, with the empty space in the bottom right corner.

## Features

- Time Limit: The game has a maximum time limit of 60 minutes. The timer starts as soon as the game begins, and your progress will be evaluated based on the time taken to complete the puzzle.
- Move Counter: The game keeps track of the number of moves you make to complete the puzzle. Try to solve it using the minimum number of moves.
- Local Storage: Once you successfully complete the puzzle, your game statistics, including the number of moves and time taken, will be stored in the browser's local storage.

## Installation
